# Currently the fork https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-wasi-nn/tree/ggml
# contains an older version of wasi-nn which is generated from .witx and not
# newer .wit spec format file. This causes issues when trying to compose a
# core wasm module into a component module. I'll take a look at updating this
# fork, but for now I'm going to comment out this dependency for the example
# that used wasmedge. The fork adds support for GGML which is why I want to used
# it.
